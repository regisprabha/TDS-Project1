Data was scraped from GitHub using the GitHub API, focusing on Austin-based users with over 100 followers, capturing profile details, public repositories, follower counts, programming languages, and repository features like projects and wikis to analyze patterns in user engagement and repository settings.
The most interesting and surprising fact you found after analyzing the data is that enabling both project and wiki features, crafting detailed bios to attract followers, and choosing popular licenses like MIT or Apache-2.0 can collectively enhance repository engagement, increase followers, and make repositories more accessible to collaborators.
Based on the analysis, developers can boost engagement and follower growth by crafting detailed bios, enabling both project and wiki features for a more interactive repository experience, and using widely recognized licenses like MIT or Apache-2.0 to make their repositories more accessible and appealing to collaborators.
